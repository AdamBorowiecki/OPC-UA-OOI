# Introduction #

This project is aimed to provide a library for Part 14 using the concept described in the [
OPC UA Data Processing Outside the Server](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution#opc-ua-data-processing-outside-the-server)

The code is tested using the Unit Test located in the project: https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/Tests/DataManagementUnitTest

The project is in development stage - major changes are expected.

#Architecture#

The library is designed to be a foundation for developing application programs that are parties of message centric communication pattern. The diagram presents relationship between the `DataMangement` library and other communication parties where the library is expanded to provide custom functionality.

In figure below the relationship between this library and external libraries is presented. Any application engaging the DataManagemnet is composed using the dependency injection pattern.

#Asumptions#

* It is assumed that the data consumer is lightweight and may support limited encoding/decoding functionality. The functionality will be  provided as a plug-in library injected at run time. EncodingDecoding is recognizable using a pair of: name recovered from the Type object and OPC UA DataType represented by its URI.
* Data binding - it is assumed that the binding of Local repositories/variables and messages content items is provided by the configuration. It could be also provided at runtime by updating the configuration using any external mechanism.

# Remarks #
## Bindings and encodings implementation ##

Binding between the local repository (e.g. HMI Screen, Server Address Space) and the message content items is provided by the `IBinding` interface and its basic implementation `Binding` class. This class is responsible to decode the data from the format used to construct the message to the local type. See definition for details:
[IBinding](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/blob/master/SemanticDataSolution/DataManagement/IBinding.cs).
It is expected that the value conversion (decoding) is provided by an instance of the IValueConverter class. If it is not applicable the [Adapter patern](http://www.dofactory.com/net/adapter-design-pattern) must be used.
* See how it works in the unir test class: [BindingUnitTest](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/blob/master/SemanticDataSolution/Tests/DataManagementUnitTest/BindingUnitTest.cs).
