# Using OPC UA Data Ouside of the Server

## Domain Model

Main challenge that must be faced up by engineering of the data processing process is preservation of the data semantics at all the stages of this process. This diagram is a domain model, which presents a high level conceptual framework of the OPC **UA Semantics Data** supporting contextual data processing outside of the *OPC UA Server*. It presents all the major contributors processing the data in context of **UA Information Model**.

**UA Semantics Data** is directly used by the following classes of actors:
* **Address Space Management** -  part of the *OPC UA Server* optionally supporting integration services
* **UA Client** -  custom OPC **UA Client** supporting additionally integration services
* **UA Data Application** - an application program processing the data in context of the OPC UA metadata without the *OPC UA Server* session.

Integration services are responsible for exchanging the data and metadata with other parties using:

* Network communication
* Database access

## UA Semantics Data

The OPC **UA Semantics Data** represents the following triple:

* Globally Unique Identifier   
* Data Type as an Entity of the *OPC UA Information Model*
* Data Object in Context of *OPC UA Address Space*

Any data object is always just a stream of bits. To understand the binary data we must have defined a data type â€“ a description how to create an appropriate bits pattern. Simplifying, the data type determines a set of valid values and rules needed to assign the information (understand the data) to a selected bits pattern.

OPC UA specification provides additional possibility to define meaning of the data, i.e. exposing the data in the context of metadata. In this case the data is made available as the *Value* attribute of the *Variable* node and surrounded by other nodes creating part of relationship.

Unique identifier and both methods of data meaning definition makeup a concept of OPC **UA Semantics Data**. Again this concept can be implemented using the *OPC UA Information Model* to define types and *OPC UA Address Space Model* to expose the data in the context of metadata.

To keep all benefits of the OPC **UA Semantics Data** concept the remote end users (UA Data Application) are interested to process the data using relevant part of the *OPC UA Address Space*.

Some scenarios where the OPC **UA Semantics Data** is used requires that the data is protected against:

* Unauthorized Access  
* Non-repudiation
* Integrity

Each node in the *OPC UA Address Space* is a root of a tree structure created by nodes recursively pointed out by HierarchicalReferences in forward direction. Because each node in this hierarchy is globally recognizable it may be protected as a resource by any independent protection system (for example any Kerberos protocol implementation) supporting authentication and authorization operation and responsible to distribute security tokens used to protect the data as stated above. Hierarchical relationship supports permissions inheritance, i.e. permissions propagation to the children nodes.

## UA Information Model

The description of the *OPC UA Information Model* is captured in detail in:
* [OPC Unified Architecture e-book](http://www.commsvr.com/UAModelDesigner/Index.aspx)
* [OPC UA Information Model Deployment]( http://www.cas.internetdsl.pl/commserver/P_DowloadCenter/P_Publications/20140301EN_DeploymentInformationModel.pdf)

## Interoperable parties

### UA Data Application

OPC **UA Data** Centric **Application** Program (shortened to **UA Data Application**) is any software program designed to perform a specific function directly for the user or for another application programs. Application programs processes (consume and produce) the OPC **UA Semantics Data** according to selected algorithm to meet the user requirements.

The **UA Data Application** gets access to the **UA Semantics Data** as:
* Networked computer device;
* Client of Database Management System;

### Address Space Management

The **Address Space Management** is a typical part of any *OPC UA Server*. It is responsible for:
* *OPC UA Address Space* instantiation - creation and management of the server address space
* **Data Binding** - managing of the links to the underlain process **Raw Data**
* **Integration** services - optionally supporting interoperability with other parties outside the server     

OPC UA specification introduces a node notion as an atomic addressable entity that consists of attributes (value-holders) and references (address-holders of coupled nodes).  The set of nodes that an *OPC UA Server* makes available to clients is referred to as its address space, which enables representation of both underlying processes environment description and its state/behavior. The address space exposed by the server makes up a context the **Raw Data** is made available to the clients. Instantiation of this context depends on an application domain unique *OPC UA Information Model* and is governed by the *OPC UA Address Space Model* rules.

The **UA Server Services** access data and metadata and makes them available to the **UA Client** using a set of non expandable services compliant with the specification.

The **Address Space Management** activity includes also creation of data bindings with the underlying real-time process (**Raw Data**).  **Data binding** is responsible for coupling  **Raw Data** representing current state/behavior of the underlying real-time process with the appropriate nodes in the address space. **Data Binding**, therefore, is the process that establishes a connection between the *Variable* node and selected data source. The *Value* attribute of the *Variable* node reflects changes when made. It can also mean that when the *Value* attribute of the *Variable* is changed, the underlying data will reflect that change.

Optionally the **Address Space Management** activity may also provide systems integration services supporting the process of bringing together the component external applications (not OPC **UA Server Services** aware) into one system and ensuring that the applications function together as a whole.  It includes but is not limited to linking together different software applications physically or functionally on the basis of common data and metadata compliant with applied *OPC UA Information Models*.  These services should provide the following functions:

* Selection of the *Variable* nodes (integration data) that are to be made available to the external applications           
* Distribution and update of the selection set information to the inter-operable parties       
* Selection of the data exchange channels, i.e. network links, databases, etc.
* Data security protection services
* Data discovery support services   

Optionally the **Address Space Management** could expose supplementary **UA Information Model** aimed to control remotely the data exchange channels by an *OPC UA Client* customized to be compliant with this model.

The underlying process **Raw Data** may also be processed by any **Application** simultaneously. This kind of activity is outside of the presented concept scope.

### UANodeSetValidation library

#### Description

The [UANodeSetValidation](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/UANodeSetValidation) project is aimed to validate UANodeSet xml files.
To validate a new model add the code to the [USNodeSetValidationUnitTestProject](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/USNodeSetValidationUnitTestProject)
and XML file to the XMLModels in this project. If the validation test does not recognize an error the code in the UANodeSetValidation must be improved.
In this case add issue or modify the code on your fork and add purge request after finishing.

#### Public API

Public API of the [UANodeSetValidation](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/UANodeSetValidation) is described by the interface:
*IAddressSpaceContext*

This interface may be used for dependency injection.
