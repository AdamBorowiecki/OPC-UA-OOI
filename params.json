It is implemented based on the [OPC Unified Architecture](http://goo.gl/y4EHUn) - a new emerging industrial integration standard that fulfills the proposed architecture requirements.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to workout deliverables supporting Process Data handling over Internet including but not limiting to:\r\n\r\n•\tData Edition – UI allowing display and edition of any custom data\r\n\r\n•\tData serialization and deserialization - see whitepaper: [Address Space Interchange XML](http://goo.gl/LE64MA)\r\n\r\n•\tData binding – to define how the process data relate to the real world\r\n\r\n•\tData Validation - see project [DataSerializationUnitTestProject](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/DataSerializationUnitTestProject)\r\n\r\n•\tData Prototyping  - methods and tools to design custom data types\r\n\r\n•\tData Discovery – methods and tools to find the data over the network.\r\n\r\nIn scope there are also deliverables supporting:\r\n\r\n•\tExposition of the Process Data in the context of Metadata [OPC UA Address Space Model Designer](http://www.commsvr.com/Products/OPCUA/UAModelDesigner.aspx)\r\n\r\n•\tBrowsing (using the sematic) of the Metadata to selectively access requested Process Data\r\n\r\n•\tModeling and representation of the Metadata - see whitepaper: [OPC UA Information Model Deployment] (http://goo.gl/HqYjvy)\r\n\r\n•\tValidation semantic and consistency of the Metadata - see project [UANodeSetValidationUnitTestProject](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/USNodeSetValidationUnitTestProject)\r\n\r\nThe presented approach is a real proposal for new technology wave based on the existing Internet infrastructure because it allows vendors to provide generic off-the-shelf products tested independently for interoperability.\r\n\r\n###Out of scope\r\n\r\nOut of scope is any work on exchanging the Process Data and Metadata over the network. The hope is that the interoperability can be gained as the result of usage of the OPC Unified Architecture international standard. \r\n\r\n###Conclusion\r\n\r\nI hope it is a good place to prototype and converge the OPC UA communication technology with Semantic Data, Internet Of Things, Plug and Play, Global Data Discovery, Selective Availability, etc. concepts. My goal is to bridge a gap between OPC UA technology and Industrial IT Application Domains. \r\n\r\nRedd more:\r\n\r\nThe paper **Object Oriented Internet** will be presented on the conference [3rd International Conference on Innovative Network Systems and Applications](https://fedcsis.org/inetsapp)\r\n\r\n[WIKI of this project](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/wiki)\r\n\r\n[My Blog: About enablers of future solutions](http://wwww.mpostol.wordpress.com/)\r\n\r\n[About me on LinkedIn](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/mpostol)\r\n\r\n[OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/)\r\n\r\n[Sponsored by commsvr.com](http://www.commsvr.com/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
