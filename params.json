The widespread use of the HTTP and hypertext makes it possible to freely publish new information and expose it in a context of its description. Unfortunately, this is a human-centric environment that cannot easily be adapted for the application-centric approach, which is required to provide globally distributed enterprise management and real-time process control. In this project new architecture is to be reserched that can be used to provide a generic solution for publishing and updating information in a context that can be used to describe and discover it. It is accomplished by distributing publisher (server) tasks to three classes: \r\n\r\n1. information context management using object oriented programming paradigm, \r\n2. a predefined fixed set of services that are used to access the data and meta-date, and \r\n3. a pluggable custom data binding mechanism. \r\n\r\nIt is proposed to implement this architecture using the [OPC Unified Architecture](http://goo.gl/y4EHUn) - a new emerging industrial integration standard that fulfills these architecture requirements. \r\n\r\nThat makes the presented approach a real proposal for new technology wave based on the existing Internet infrastructure because it allows vendors to provide generic off-the-shelf products tested independently for interoperability\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to workout deliverables supporting Process Data handling over Internet including but not limiting to:\r\n\r\n•\tData Edition – UI allowing display and edition of any custom data\r\n\r\n•\tData serialization and deserialization - see whitepaper: [Address Space Interchange XML](http://goo.gl/LE64MA)\r\n\r\n•\tData binding – to define how the process data relate to the real world\r\n\r\n•\tData Validation - see project [DataSerializationUnitTestProject](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/DataSerializationUnitTestProject)\r\n\r\n•\tData Prototyping  - methods and tools to design custom data types\r\n\r\n•\tData Discovery – methods and tools to find the data over the network.\r\n\r\nIn scope there are also deliverables supporting:\r\n\r\n•\tExposition of the Process Data in the context of Metadata\r\n\r\n•\tBrowsing (using the sematic) of the Metadata to selectively access requested Process Data\r\n\r\n•\tModeling and representation of the Metadata - see whitepaper: [OPC UA Information Model Deployment] (http://goo.gl/HqYjvy)\r\n\r\n•\tValidation semantic and consistency of the Metadata - see project [UANodeSetValidationUnitTestProject](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/SemanticDataSolution/USNodeSetValidationUnitTestProject)\r\n\r\n##Out of scope\r\n\r\nOut of scope is any work on exchanging the Process Data and Metadata over the network. The hope is that the interoperability can be gained as the result of usage of the OPC Unified Architecture international standard. \r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\n\r\nI hope it is a good place to prototype and converge the OPC UA communication technology with Semantic Data, Internet Of Things, Plug and Play, Global Data Discovery, Selective Availability, etc. concepts. My goal is to bridge a gap between OPC UA technology and Industrial IT Application Domains. \r\n\r\nRedd more:\r\n\r\n[WIKI](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/wiki)\r\n\r\n[My Blog](http://wwww.mpostol.wordpress.com/)\r\n\r\n[About me](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/mpostol)\r\n\r\n[OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
